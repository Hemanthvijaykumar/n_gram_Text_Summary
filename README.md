# n_gram_Text_Summary
Extract top Sentences using n-gram weights. 
Generally, frequency of n-grams (other than stop words) in a document is indicative of its importance in communicating its content. 
By corollary, presence of high frequency n-grams in a sentence would indicate importance of that sentence. 
We will do 3 sentence rankings using 1-gram, 2-gram and 3-gram weights respectively. 
And combine them for an overall ranking of sentences of a text corpus.
